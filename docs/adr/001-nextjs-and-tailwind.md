## Date
2025-02-16

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Context
We needed to choose a framework for building Game Vault, a web application that hosts mini-games. Key requirements included:
- Fast page loads and good SEO
- Responsive design
- Component reusability
- Easy state management
- Modern development experience
- Type safety
- Scalability for future games

## Decision
We decided to use:
1. Next.js 14 (App Router) as our React framework
2. Tailwind CSS for styling
3. TypeScript for type safety
4. Headless UI for accessible components

## Consequences

### Positive
- Next.js provides excellent SEO through server-side rendering
- App Router enables easier route organization and data fetching
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with consistent design
- TypeScript adds type safety and better developer experience
- Component libraries like Headless UI provide accessible, unstyled components
- Easy deployment through Vercel platform

### Negative
- Learning curve for developers new to Next.js App Router
- Bundle size might be larger than simpler alternatives
- Tailwind classes can make HTML markup verbose
- Need to manage component state carefully in games

### Neutral
- Need to follow Next.js best practices for routing
- Regular updates required to maintain security
- Tailwind configuration needs to be maintained
